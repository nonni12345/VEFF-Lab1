## Getting started using the starter pack
1. Navigate to the `project_starter` folder in a terminal window.
2. Install the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages listed in `package.json` by running the `npm install` command
(note: `npm i` does the same thing). This will fetch all the required packages needed to run the
starter pack.
3. To start up the development process, you can run the `npm start` command.
4. The process will now print out a link to the URL the process is running on. It should look
something like this:

```
VITE v4.0.1  ready in 407 ms
➜  Local: http://127.0.0.1:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h to show help
```

5. You are now ready to develop your solution with all sorts of enhanced developer
experience features such as HMR (Hot module replacement) which instantly reloads
your browser when you make changes to your project files.
6. Please note that we are only using the starter pack to improve the development
experience and speed up your workflow so you can focus on the task at hand. It makes
no changes to the project in any other way.
